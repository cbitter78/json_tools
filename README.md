# My JSON Tools

Not novel or original, but they are mine.  :^)

Just some scripts I find very useful when working with JSON.

## Running

All these scripts requrie python 3.x.  These scripts have requirements.
I suggest you use a venv or the like to run them

First do this:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip --isolated install --upgrade pip
pip --isolated install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the scripts.

## Docker

TODO: Need a good dockerfile for this.

## Scripts

- [squisher.py](squisher.py) is a script that will take JSON in any format and output
it in a squished or minimalist format.  No white space or pritty formatting.

- [bonita.py](bonita.py) is a script that will take a JSON file in any format and output
  it in a pretty JSON format.
